Optimizing Video Engagement Through Sentiment Analysis ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“Š
This project explores the impact of user interactions (likes, dislikes, and comments) on YouTube video engagement using sentiment analysis. By leveraging deep learning models (TinyBERT, MiniLM) and traditional machine learning techniques (NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression), the study aims to classify sentiments from video titles and engagement metrics.

Key Features
âœ… Dataset: 161,470 YouTube video records (Kaggle dataset)
âœ… Sentiment Analysis: VADER, TextBlob, Flair, and Transformer models
âœ… Model Comparisons: TinyBERT (90.31% accuracy) vs. MiniLM (89.16%) vs. traditional ML
âœ… Implementation: Python, Google Colab (GPU-accelerated)
